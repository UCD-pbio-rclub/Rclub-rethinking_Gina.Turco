# Statistical Rethinking Chapter 2, sections 2.1 - 2.3

Name: Gina Turco

## 2E1

**(2)** Pr(rain|Monday)

## 2E2

**(4)** The probability that it is Monday and that it is raining.

## 2E3

**(4)** Pr(rain|Monday)Pr(Monday)/Pr(rain)


## 2E4

That it is highly likey that there is 70% water on the world  based on our small world data. It is also highly likey to have a value simialr to 70% such 40-80% and much more unlikely to have a value simliar to 1% or 100%.

## 2M3

Posterior = Likelihood Ã— Prior Average Likelihood

Pr(Earth|land) = Pr(land|Earth) * Pr(Earth) / Pr(land)

Pr(Earth) = 0.5

Pr(Land) = 0.5

Pr(land|Earth) =  Pr(Earth|land) 

Pr(Earth|land)  = 0.23 * 0.5/ 0.5

Pr(Earth|land)  = 0.23

## 2M4
|Conjecture | counts | ways to produce | new count |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|-----------|
|white, white |= 1 |X 0 |= 0   |
|black, white |= 2 |X 1 |= 2/3 |
|black, black |= 1 |X 1 |= 1/3 |

_JNM: Nice table but I think the conjectures don't match up with the counts correctly._
